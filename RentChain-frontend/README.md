## 🌍 **The Problem: A Broken Rental Market**

The rental housing market is in crisis. **Millions of people worldwide** face the same nightmare:

### **For Renters:**
- 🚫 **No Trust**: Sending thousands to strangers with no guarantees
- 💸 **Hidden Fees**: "Application fees," "broker fees," "security deposits" that magically appear
- 📊 **Credit Discrimination**: Bad credit? No apartment, even if you can afford it
- 🤷‍♂️ **No Transparency**: Is this landlord reliable? Will they fix things? Who knows?
- ⏰ **Payment Headaches**: Late fees, unclear due dates, no payment history
- ⚖️ **Dispute Hell**: Something breaks? Good luck getting it fixed

### **For Landlords:**
- 💔 **Deadbeat Tenants**: People who don't pay rent or trash your property
- 📈 **No Credit History**: How do you know if someone can afford rent?
- 💳 **Payment Delays**: Waiting for checks, dealing with bounced payments
- 🏚️ **Property Damage**: No way to hold tenants accountable
- ⚖️ **Legal Costs**: Evictions, court battles, lawyer fees

**The current "solutions" are broken**: Traditional agencies are expensive and slow, online platforms offer no protection, and word-of-mouth is unreliable.
